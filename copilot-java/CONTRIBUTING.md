# How to contribute

As a Solutions Engineer in PEX, you want to contribute to this repo to help customers to get started with Copilot for Java. You can contribute to this repo by adding new demos or improving existing demos.

Try to be descriptive as much as possible! Capture screenshots and link to your documentation so it is easier to follow for everyone.

## How to add a new demo

1. Create a new branch from `main` branch. The branch name should be descriptive and should not contain any spaces. For example, `create-new-demo` is a good name for a branch.
2. Create a new folder for your demo under `Demo`. The folder name should be descriptive and should not contain any spaces. For example, `GettingStarted` is a good name for a folder.
3. Add a file named `README.md` in the folder. This file should contain the demo instructions. You can use [this template](README_TEMPLATE.md) as a starting point.
4. If you have any script, you need to add to the folder. For example, if you have a notebook, you need to add it to the folder. You can add any other files that are needed for the demo. If you have images, you can create a new folder called `images` in your own folder, and add images to that folder. Link the images to your documentation.
5. Update `README.md` in the root of repository to update the index of demos.
6. Create a pull request to merge your branch to `main` branch.

## How to improve an existing demo

If you see any typo or information that needs to be updated, you can create a pull request to update the demo. You can also create a pull request to add more information to the demo.
