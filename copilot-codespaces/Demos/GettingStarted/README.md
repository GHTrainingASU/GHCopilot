# Getting started - Creating a simple Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with Codespaces

Welcome to GitHub Copilot!

For this first dive, we will take a look at a very familiar game and see if we can leverage GitHub Copilot to help us create all the functioning code necessary to setup Rock, Paper, Scissors.

We will walk you through all of the steps necessary to create the working game, understand what the prompts are doing when we enter them and get to utilize Codespaces at the same time. 

This demo was created by GitHub's very own @blackgirlbytes and transferred into this organization's repository for the professional services team. If you would like to view the original repository, you can view that [here](https://github.com/blackgirlbytes/rock-paper-scissors-copilot). 

# Build a Rock, Paper, Scissors Game with GitHub Copilot

## Description
This is a self-guided tutorial to help folks learn how to use GitHub Copilot. In this project you will find: 
* a `main.py` file with no contents
* a devcontainer that installs CodeTour and GitHub Copilot when the Codespace is created
* a CodeTour to guide the developer through using GitHub Copilot to develop a rock, paper, scissors game. 

## To complete this tutorial, you will need:
* Access to [GitHub Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot)

## How does this work?
The CodeTour prompts developers to write comments and lines of code that trigger GitHub Copilot to generate code to create a rock, paper, scissors game.

## How to use the guided CodeTour

1. Choose 'Use this template', and 'Open in a codespace'

## Your CodeTour will take you through the following steps
1. Introduction: Hi there! this is a guided tour to help you learn GitHub Copilot. We will build a rock, paper, scissors game with Python.


2. Let's give GitHub Copilot some context about what we're building. Write this comment `# Write a rock, paper, scissors, game` at the top of your main.py file.

Now, let's prompt Copilot to import the random module. Write this comment `# import random module` on the next line. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion.

3. Now, let's prompt Copilot to create a main function that handles the logic of the game with a comment that says `# define main function that handles all the logic`. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion. 

<img width="1498" alt="define main function" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22990146/222715649-84631082-4771-4b5b-9236-9b396a7b313e.png">

4. Now, let's prompt Copilot to call the main function. Write this comment `# call main function` on the next line. Press enter to create a new line and accept Copilot's suggestion. 

<img width="1507" alt="Call main function" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22990146/222715869-176895c5-26bb-43a7-adb1-fe579064f689.png">

5. Try it out! Let's run the code to see if it works. In your terminal, run `python3 main.py`. It should start the rock, paper, scissors game. Mission complete! You've used GitHub Copilot to create a rock, paper, scissors game in Python!
